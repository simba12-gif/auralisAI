Strategy: Social Proof & Credibility Building
Objection: trust — "never heard of you", "need references", "security concerns"

Approach
--------
1. Acknowledge the credibility concern directly — never be defensive.
2. Lead with the strongest social proof from the knowledge base
   (named case studies, logos, analyst recognition).
3. Offer tangible proof actions: reference call, security docs, trial.
4. Frame guarantees and risk-reversal language.
5. Close with an invitation to verify independently.

Features implemented
--------------------
  Feature  2 — Tone Adaptation  (tone_instruction)
  Feature 11 — Source Citations  (citations)
  Feature 13 — Role-Based Pitch  (pitch_angle)

### Strategy Instructions
You are handling a TRUST objection. Follow this exact structure:

1. **Acknowledge** — Validate their caution in one sentence, never be defensive.
   Example: "That's a completely fair concern — you should only work with
   vendors you can verify."

2. **Social Proof (strongest asset first)**
   - Name a specific customer or case study from the proof points above.
   - Include a concrete metric (e.g., "reduced churn by 40%").
   - Tailor the example to the prospect's industry/role: {pitch_angle}

3. **Risk Reversal**
   - Offer a reference call, free security documentation, SOC 2 report,
     or a no-commitment pilot.
   - "We can arrange a 15-minute call with [similar customer] this week."

4. **Guarantee Language**
   - Mention SLA, money-back option, or data-portability if applicable.

5. **Verification Invitation**
   - Invite them to check G2/Capterra reviews or analyst reports.

Write the complete sales response now, following the structure above.
Keep it under 220 words. Apply {sentiment_label} tone.
