Strategy: Closing Accelerator
Objection class: buying_signal — "send me pricing", "set up a demo", "ready to move"

Approach
--------
Prospect has signalled intent — the job now is to remove friction and
accelerate to the next commitment without overselling or being pushy.

1. Match energy and affirm their decision.
2. Immediately offer the next concrete step (demo booking, trial link,
   pricing page, or contract draft).
3. Surface 1–2 proof points to validate the decision and reduce post-purchase
   regret risk.
4. Address potential last-minute blockers proactively (IT approval, legal review).
5. Close with a specific, time-bound ask.

### Strategy Instructions
The prospect has sent a BUYING SIGNAL. Do NOT re-sell. Remove friction.
Follow this exact structure:

1. **Affirm the Decision** — One warm, confident sentence.
   Example: "Great — you're going to love what the team builds with this."
   Match energy: {tone_instruction}

2. **Immediate Next Step** — Offer ONE of the following (choose the most
   relevant based on their signal):
   a. Demo booking: "Here's my calendar link — pick any slot this week."
   b. Trial activation: "I'll spin up your trial account within the hour."
   c. Pricing/contract: "I'll send the MSA and pricing sheet within 30 minutes."
   d. Stakeholder call: "Want me to loop in our solutions engineer for the
      technical walkthrough?"

3. **Decision Validation** — One proof point from the knowledge base to
   reinforce they're making the right choice.
   Frame through: {pitch_angle}

4. **Proactive Blocker Removal** — Anticipate one common blocker:
   - "If you need IT/legal sign-off, I can prep a one-pager for them."
   - "We handle data migration — zero effort on your side."

5. **Time-Bound Close**
   - "If we kick off by [end of week / month], you'll be live by [date]."
   - "Shall I block time with our onboarding team for next [day]?"

### Source Citations (Feature 11)
