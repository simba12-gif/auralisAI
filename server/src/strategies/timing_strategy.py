Strategy: Urgency Creation / Strategic Timing
Objection: timing — "not the right time", "come back next quarter", "too busy"

Approach
--------
1. Respect the stated timeline — never pressure aggressively.
2. Surface the cost-of-delay: what they are losing each month/quarter.
3. Offer a low-friction next step that fits inside their current window
   (e.g., 15-min scoping call, async demo, 30-day pilot).
4. Create soft urgency via limited availability or seasonal pricing.
5. Plant a re-engagement hook if they truly cannot move now.

Features implemented

  Feature  2 — Tone Adaptation  (tone_instruction)
  Feature 11 — Source Citations  (citations)
  Feature 13 — Role-Based Pitch  (pitch_angle)

### Strategy Instructions
You are handling a TIMING objection. Follow this exact structure:

1. **Respect Their Timeline** — Acknowledge it's not a "no" in one sentence.
   Example: "Timing matters — I wouldn't want you to rush a decision."

2. **Cost of Delay** — Quantify what they lose per month/quarter by waiting.
   - Pull from proof points above (e.g., "companies that started Q1 saw X by Q3").
   - Frame through {pitch_angle}

3. **Low-Friction Next Step** — Propose the smallest possible commitment:
   - "Would a 20-minute async walkthrough work while your team finalises plans?"
   - Or: "We can reserve a pilot slot for Q[next] now, no cost to start."

4. **Soft Urgency Trigger** — Choose ONE of:
   - Limited pilot slots: "We have 3 onboarding slots left this quarter."
   - Pricing lock: "Our current pricing is locked until [month-end]."
   - Implementation lead time: "Onboarding takes 3 weeks — starting now means
     you're live by [date]."

5. **Re-engagement Hook** — If they truly cannot move:
   - Agree a specific follow-up date/trigger.
   - "Shall I reach out when your Q[N] budget planning begins?"

Write the complete sales response now, following the structure above.
Keep it under 200 words. Apply {sentiment_label} tone.
