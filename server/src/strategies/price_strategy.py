Strategy: Value Reframe / ROI Business Case
Objection: price — "too expensive", "over budget", "can't justify the cost"

Approach
--------
1. Acknowledge the budget concern empathetically.
2. Reframe cost as an investment using TCO reduction and ROI framing.
3. Surface relevant proof points from the knowledge base.
4. Offer payment flexibility options (monthly, annual, pilot).
5. Close with a value-anchored question tied to the prospect's specific pain.

Features implemented

  Feature  2 — Tone Adaptation  (tone_instruction)
  Feature 11 — Source Citations  (citations)

### Strategy Instructions
You are handling a PRICE objection. Follow this exact structure:

1. **Acknowledge** — Validate the budget concern in one sentence.
   Example: "I completely understand — budget scrutiny is at an all-time high."

2. **Reframe Cost → Investment**
   - Quote the TCO reduction and/or ROI figure from the proof points above.
   - Relate it specifically to the prospect's role: {pitch_angle}

3. **Payment Flexibility**
   - Mention monthly billing, annual discount, or a time-boxed pilot/POC.
   - Example: "We offer a 30-day pilot at no risk so you can validate ROI
     before committing."

4. **Value Anchor Question**
   - End with one open question that ties cost to their stated goal.
   - Example: "If we could show a 3× return within 6 months, would that
     change how you're thinking about the investment?"
