# Zoho CRM

## Weaknesses
- Interface complexity: Zoho's breadth (40+ apps) creates a fragmented, inconsistent UX that overwhelms new users.
- AI features (Zia) are basic: intent detection is rule-based and lacks the NLP depth of purpose-built conversation AI.
- Data quality issues: duplicate record management is weak; large-scale cleanups are manual and time-consuming.
- Support quality: community-first support model means critical issues can take 24–72 hours to resolve on paid plans.
- Customisation is powerful but brittle: heavy custom modules often break after platform updates.
- Reporting requires Zoho Analytics (a separate product, separate cost) for anything beyond basic dashboards.
- Perception problem: frequently positioned as "cheap Salesforce" — prospects in enterprise deals may push back on brand credibility.

## Our Advantages vs Zoho CRM
- **Purpose-built for sales coaching**: Zoho Zia provides basic AI suggestions; Auralis provides real-time objection classification, sentiment detection, persona recognition, and adaptive strategy selection — all in one inference loop.
- **Reliability**: Auralis uptime SLA is 99.9% with dedicated infrastructure; Zoho has had several high-profile outages affecting all 40+ apps simultaneously.
- **Cleaner UX**: Auralis is built around a single workflow — the conversation — rather than a suite of disconnected apps.
- **Knowledge base RAG**: cited proof points surfaced mid-call; Zoho has no equivalent capability.
- **Transparent pricing**: no per-module billing, no surprise add-ons.
